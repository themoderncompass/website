We've arrived at a point where AI has or is close to commoditizing knowledge. It's no longer viable to go to college to gain knowledge and hope for a career. The current state of this is college costs continue to rise, while the value of knowledge slowly erodes.

**When AI has PhD level knowledge and learns while we sleep, what do you go to college for, how do you decide, and how can you stand out to start and progress in your career?**

## The Uncomfortable Truth

AI at this point in time is really great at some tasks like software development, troubleshooting, and technical tasks. But it's spotty at connecting the dots across what it tells you, and it doesn't have experience applying what it knows and failing - it just knows that it knows it.

**That is our crucial foothold.**

There is nothing unique about the AI's individuality and there's no trial and error, no lived experience to draw upon. That is what we can offer, but it's not always easy proving that point.

## The 3 Key Areas to Think About

I'll be honest, this is a rough time to decide to go to college. As a 40+ year old, I would not want to be facing this decision with the uncertainty of AI in the market and diminishing entry level roles that college grads would often get.

But at the same time, I'm optimistic that **being unique will pay off**, which is why it's an integral part of this framework.

### 1. Evaluate Access

What can college grant you access to? Internships, mentorships, fellowships to name a few. But that has to be weighed against the overall cost.

**The question:** If college at an Ivy League gets you the small possibility for unique mentorship but will leave you with a $300k school loan, is it worth it?

### 2. Find What Makes You Uniquely You

This isn't a joke. Finding what makes you unique and amplifying that is what will help you stand out in your endeavors and career.

The tricky part is what makes us unique is a moving target, and it evolves as we age, trial and error, and gain experience.

For me, my uniqueness boils down to a simple message: **I'm a builder, and I like to make things simpler to understand and navigate.** My natural tendency to be optimistic and positive comes through in everything I do.

### 3. Decision Making Framework

Instead of simply saying "trust your gut," I introduce what I've coined as **iTQ - your Intuitive Trust Quotient**. It's a tool that removes abstraction, expands on intuition, and makes it more tangible and actionable.

iTQ helps you assess how clearly and accurately you interpret signals - whether you're deciding to pursue a relationship, accept advice, take a risk, or decide on college.

## Most Impacted Entry-Level Positions

Before making your decision, you need to understand where AI is hitting hardest:

**TIER 1: Severe Displacement (50%+ reduction)**
- Junior Software Developers
- Journalism/Content Writers
- Investment Banking Analysts
- Bookkeeping/Accounting Clerks

**TIER 2: High Impact (35-50% reduction)**
- Marketing Coordinators
- Management Consulting Analysts
- Paralegal Research Assistants

**TIER 3: Moderate Impact (20-35% reduction)**
- HR/Recruiting Coordinators
- Financial Analysts (Entry-Level)
- Data Entry Specialists

## The Silver Lining

Here's the truth: **the data doesn't offer much comfort for traditional college graduates entering knowledge work between now and 2030.** Entry-level positions are contracting across the board.

But that gives you **permission to question whether the traditional path still makes sense** without feeling like you're settling or giving up.

The 18-year-olds making college decisions right now have something previous generations didn't: deep research at your fingertips. Use it!
