const bio = `
  For years in my 20's and 30's I tried to navigate life without a clear guide, full of ambition but
  short on direction. Progress came slowly, often in circles.

  Modern Compass grew out of that experience. It’s my way of cutting through noise and surfacing what
  really matters so you can act with clarity instead of drifting on intention alone.

  I’ve learned growth isn’t always about collecting more advice or following someone else’s formula. It’s
  about building your own compass and taking small actions that help you trust yourself more with every step.

  My goal isn’t to tell you who to be. It’s to help you see where you are, choose where you’re going, and
  help you decide where to commit your time and energy to what matters most.

  Outside of Modern Compass, I’m a product leader in tech, a husband, and a dad, a range of roles that
  keep everything I share grounded in real life.

  'Modern Compass is designed to be actionable and approachable with activities, tools, and a growing community to help',
  'I believe clarity beats complexity. If it doesn’t simplify your life or nudge you to move forward, it doesn’t belong'
