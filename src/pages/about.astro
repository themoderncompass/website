    <h1>About</h1>
    <p class="bio">
      For years in my 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s I tried to navigate life without a clear guide, full of ambition but
      short on direction. Progress came slowly, often in circles.
      
      Modern Compass grew out of that experience. It’s my way of cutting through noise and surfacing what
      really matters so you can act with clarity instead of drifting on intention alone.
      
      I’ve learned growth isn’t always about collecting more advice or following someone else’s formula. It’s
      about building your own compass and taking small actions that help you trust yourself more with every step.
      
      My goal isn’t to tell you who to be. It’s to help you see where you are, choose where you’re going, and
      help you decide where to commit your time and energy to what matters most.
      
      Outside of Modern Compass, I’m a product leader in tech, a husband, and a dad, a range of roles that
      keep everything I share grounded in real life.
      
      Always...follow your compass.

      <li>Strengthen your sense of self</li>
      <li>Deepen trust</li>

    <h3>Why trust The&nbsp;Modern&nbsp;Compass?</h3>
    <ul class="cred-list list-disc ml-5 space-y-1">
      <li>I’ve spent over a decade leading complex projects in tech and the last 5 years launching global products, turning messy topics into clear strategies and value</li>
      <li>My writing and tools are built from lived experience, tested in the realities of work, family, and growth</li>
      <li>I don’t preach quick fixes. I focus on frameworks that are easy to understand</li>
      <li>Modern Compass is designed to be actionable and approachable with activities, tools, and a growing community to help</li>
      <li>I believe clarity beats complexity. If it doesn’t simplify your life or nudge you to move forward, it doesn’t belong</li>
