  Hi, my names Josh Imholte. For much of my life, I tried to navigate without a clear guide.
  Like many people, I entered adulthood full of ambition but light on direction. Progress came,
  but often slow and at times didn't move me forward.

  Modern Compass grew out of that lived experience. I wanted a way to cut through noise, surface
  what really matters, and create a framework that helps people act with clarity instead of
  drifting on intention alone.

  Along the way, I discovered something important: growth isn’t always about collecting more
  advice or following someone else’s formula. It’s about building your own compass, taking
  small actions so that you build your own compass you can trust.

  That’s what this project is about. Through my book, newsletter, TikTok, and tools, I share
  practical ways to strengthen your sense of self, deepen trust, develop character, and build
  relationships. My goal isn’t to tell you who to be, but to help you see where you are, choose
  where you’re going, so that you have visibility on where to commit your time and energy in life.

  Outside of Modern Compass, I’m a product leader in the tech world, a husband, and a dad.
  Those roles keep me grounded in the real challenges of balancing ambition, responsibility, and
  relationships. Everything I create here is tested in that reality. No abstract theory, just
  clarity that works.

  Always follow your compass.

const credentials = [
  'I’ve spent over a decade leading complex projects in tech and the last 5 years launching global products, turning messy topics into clear strategies and value',
  'My writing and tools are built from lived experience, tested in the realities of work, family, and growth',
  'I don’t preach quick fixes. I focus on frameworks that are easy to understand',
  'Modern Compass is designed to be actionable and approachable with activities, tools, and a growing community to help',
  'I believe clarity beats complexity. If it doesn’t simplify your life or nudge you to move forward, it doesn’t belong'
