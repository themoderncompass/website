These are tasks I cannot automate but are important for completing the SEO optimization. Each includes step-by-step instructions.

## 1. Create Open Graph Share Images (Priority: HIGH)

**Time Required:** 1-2 hours
**Tools Needed:** Canva (free) or Figma (free)
**Why:** Dramatically improves social media click-through rates

### What Are Open Graph Images?

When someone shares your site on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc., these platforms pull a preview image. Without custom images, they either show nothing or grab random images from the page.

### Specifications

- **Size:** 1200px × 630px (required by Facebook/Twitter)
- **Format:** PNG or JPG
- **File size:** Under 1MB (preferably under 500KB)
- **Safe zone:** Keep text/logos within center 1000px × 500px (edges may be cropped on some platforms)

### Images You Need (5 total)

#### 1. Homepage Image (`/public/og-home.png`)
**Content:**
- Modern Compass logo (center or top)

2. **Create custom size:** Click "Create a design" → "Custom size" → 1200 × 630 px
3. **Design your image:**
   - Use gradient backgrounds (purple to blue)
   - Add text with clear hierarchy (large headline, smaller subtext)
   - Upload logos/images from your `/public` folder
   - Keep important elements in the center 1000×500px area
4. **Download:**
   - Click "Share" → "Download"
   - Select PNG format
   - Save to `/public` folder with exact names above

### After Creating Images

Update the SEO component to use specific images per page:

Edit `src/pages/index.astro` (example):
```astro

  slot="head"
  title="..."
  description="..."
  image="/og-home.png"  // ← Add this line
  ...
/>
```

Repeat for all pages using the corresponding OG image.

## 2. Compress Large Image Files (Priority: HIGH)

**Time Required:** 30 minutes
**Tools Needed:** TinyPNG.com (free) or Squoosh.app (free)
**Why:** Faster page loads = better SEO + user experience

### Current Image Sizes (Too Large!)

```
Newsletter Promo.png:  1.4 MB ❌ (Should be <300KB)
book-graphic.png:      1.5 MB ❌ (Should be <400KB)
logo.png:              1.2 MB ❌ (Should be <200KB)
impulsewallet.png:     838 KB ❌ (Should be <300KB)
TimeOS.png:            1.4 MB ❌ (Should be <300KB)
```

### Step-by-Step: Using TinyPNG

1. **Go to** https://tinypng.com
2. **Drag and drop** images from `/public` folder
3. **Download** compressed versions
4. **Replace** original files in `/public` folder
5. **Keep original file names** (so links don't break)

**Expected savings:** 60-80% file size reduction with no visible quality loss

### Step-by-Step: Using Squoosh (Alternative)

1. **Go to** https://squoosh.app
2. **Upload** an image
3. **Settings:**
   - Format: WebP (best compression) or PNG (better compatibility)
   - Quality: 85% for photos, 90% for graphics
4. **Download** and replace in `/public` folder

### Bonus: Convert to WebP Format (Optional)

WebP images are 25-35% smaller than PNG/JPG with same quality.

**How:**
1. Use Squoosh.app to convert PNG → WebP
2. Keep original PNGs as fallback
3. Update image references in Astro files:

```astro
<picture>
  <source srcset="/image.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <img src="/image.png" alt="Description" />
</picture>
```
