# Blog Content Strategy - Modern Compass

This document outlines a comprehensive content strategy to drive organic traffic and newsletter signups through SEO-optimized blog posts.

---

## Content Pillars

Modern Compass content should align with the 4 core directions:

1. **Self** - Self-awareness, confidence, self-control, personal worth
2. **Trust** - Trust-building, informed trust, relationships
3. **Character** - Values, authenticity, purpose
4. **Relationships** - Connection, empathy, loyalty, communication

**Blog posts should:**
- Address a specific pain point within one of these pillars
- Provide actionable frameworks or exercises
- Link back to newsletter, book, or resources
- Target keywords with search intent matching your audience

## Performance Metrics to Track

Monitor these metrics monthly in Google Analytics + Search Console:

### Traffic Metrics
- **Organic traffic** (from Google search)
- **Top landing pages** (which posts get most traffic?)
- **Bounce rate** (under 60% is good)
- **Average time on page** (3+ minutes is excellent)

### Engagement Metrics
- **Scroll depth** (are people reading to the end?)
- **Click-through rate** on CTAs (newsletter, book, resources)
- **Newsletter signups** attributed to blog posts

### SEO Metrics
- **Average ranking** for target keywords (top 10 is goal)
- **Impressions** (how often posts show in search)
- **Click-through rate** from search (5%+ is good)
- **Backlinks** (other sites linking to your posts)

### Optimization Actions Based on Data

**If bounce rate is high (>70%):**
- Improve hook (first 100 words)
- Add more visual breaks (bullet points, subheadings)
- Check page load speed

**If time on page is low (<2 minutes):**
- Content may not match search intent
- Too much fluff, not enough value
- Add more specific, actionable advice

**If CTR from search is low (<3%):**
- Rewrite title to be more compelling
- Improve meta description
- Test different emotional hooks

**If ranking is low (position 11-30):**
- Expand content (add 300-500 words)
- Add more internal links pointing to that post

**Total time:** 5-6 hours per post

### Monthly (Optimal Pace: 2 posts per month)

- Week 1: Publish post #1
- Week 2: Research + draft post #2

**Month 12:** 24-32 posts, 10-15 ranking in top 10, 500-1,000 organic visitors/month
